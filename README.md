This just uses the example tests created by Cypress.

pnpm cypress open
chose `e2e testing`
chose `chrome`
chose `todo.cy.js`
it took 1:06 the first time, 0:33 the second time, then 0:05, ran maybe 4 or 5 more times and got down to 0:02, then it got really laggy and took 1:24
`cmd + q` to close cypress

did the same as above but chose `firefox` instead:
it took 0:04 the first time, and 0:02 the next 10 times

did the same as above but chose `electron` instead:
it took 0:03 the first time, and 0:01 the next 10 times
